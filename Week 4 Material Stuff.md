## DNA Structure and Manipulation

### DNA Structure in Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes
- **Prokaryotes:**
  - Circular, double-stranded DNA.
  - Nucleoid region in cytoplasm.
  - Lack true nucleus and histones.
  - Usually one chromosome.

- **Eukaryotes:**
  - Linear, double-stranded DNA.
  - Enclosed within nucleus.
  - Have true nucleus and histones.
  - Multiple linear chromosomes.

### Transcription and Translation
**Transcription:**

1. **Initiation:**
   - RNA polymerase binds to promoter.
   - DNA unwinds, template strand used.
   
2. **Elongation:**
   - RNA polymerase adds RNA nucleotides.
   - Forms RNA transcript.

3. **Termination:**
   - RNA polymerase reaches terminator.
   - RNA transcript released.

**Translation:**

1. **Initiation:**
   - Ribosome binds to mRNA start codon.
   - Initiator tRNA binds.
   
2. **Elongation:**
   - Aminoacyl tRNA adds amino acids.
   - Peptide bond formation.
   - Ribosome translocates.

3. **Termination:**
   - Ribosome reaches stop codon.
   - Release factors, polypeptide released.

## Genetic Concepts and Techniques

### DNA Profiling Techniques

**Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):**
- Amplifies DNA sequences.
- Separates DNA strands, adds primers, synthesizes new strands.

**Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Analysis:**
- Analyzes repeating DNA sequences (STRs).
- Generates unique genetic profiles based on repeat lengths.

**Gel Electrophoresis:**
- Separates DNA fragments based on size and charge.
- Visualizes DNA bands for analysis.

### Applications of DNA Profiling

- **Criminal Justice and Forensics:** Identify suspects, solve crimes.
- **Paternity and Relationship Testing:** Determine parentage, reunify families.
- **Medical and Health:** Genetic disorders, pharmacogenetics.
- **Ancestry and Genealogy:** Tracing family history, migration patterns.
- **Wildlife Conservation:** Species identification, combat illegal trade.
- **Agriculture and Food Safety:** Crop improvement, food traceability.

## Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)

### Benefits of GMOs

- Increased crop yield and quality.
- Reduced pesticide use.
- Disease resistance.
- Improved nutritional content.
- Bioremediation.

### Risks and Concerns of GMOs

- Loss of biodiversity.
- Allergenicity and unintended effects.
- Resistance development.
- Ethical and social concerns.

### Regulation and Management

- Labeling and transparency.
- Risk assessment and monitoring.
- Coexistence measures.
- Gene flow management.

## Phylogenetics and Evolution

### Phylogenetic Trees

- Nodes represent common ancestors.
- Branches show evolutionary relationships.
- Tips represent current species.
- Sister taxa share recent common ancestor.
- Convergent evolution results in analogous traits.

### Homology, Analogy, Convergent Evolution

- **Homology:** Similar traits due to shared ancestry.
- **Analogy:** Similar traits due to independent evolution (homoplasy).
- **Convergent Evolution:** Independent evolution of similar traits in different lineages.

## Species Definition and Concepts

### Biological Concept of Species

- **Definition:** Groups interbreeding populations.
- **Reproductive isolation:** Members breed within group.
- **Limitations:** Asexual organisms, extinct species.

### Other Definitions of Species

- **Morphological Concept:** Physical traits.
- **Ecological Concept:** Adaptations to environment.
- **Phylogenetic Concept:** Evolutionary history.
- **Recognition Concept:** Mate recognition.

## Viruses and Their Roles

- **Virus Structure:** Genetic material, capsid, envelope, spikes.
- **Roles in Society:** Disease agents, medical research, biotechnology, ecology, evolution, therapy, bioremediation.
