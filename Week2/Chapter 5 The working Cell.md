# 1) Define the terms energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, and the principle of conservation of energy.
## Energy:
- Defined as the capacity to cause change
## Kinetic Energy:
- Is the energy of motion
## Potential Energy:
- Is stored energy
- Energy that an object has because of its location or structure
## the principle of conservation of energy
- energy is a conserved quantity, and its total amount within a system remains unchanged, even if it undergoes various transformations between different forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, or electrical energy
- This principle is a foundational concept in understanding the behavior of physical systems and is a cornerstone of various scientific fields, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism

# 2) Explain how ATP powers cellular work
## ATP:
- Acts like an energy shuttle
- Stores energy obtained from food
- releases it later as needed
- consists of an organic molecule called adenosine plus a tail of three phosphate groups
**Cellular Work and ATP:**
- Mechanical Work: ATP is used to power muscle contraction and other cellular movements
- Transport Work: ATP provides energy to transport molecules and ions across cell membranes against their concentration gradients
- Chemical Work: ATP energizes metabolic reactions by providing the necessary activation energy for chemical processes

# 3) Explain how enzymes are able to speed up specific chemical reactions
- They accomplish this by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed, making it easier and faster for the reaction to occur
## Key Points:
- **Activation Energy:** 
	- Every chemical reaction requires a certain amount of energy to initiate, known as the activation energy
	- It is the energy needed to break the bonds in the reactant molecules and start the reaction
- **Enzyme-Substrate Interaction:** 
	- Enzymes are highly specific in their action. 
	- They bind to specific molecules called substrates at their active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.
- **Active Site:** 
	- The active site of the enzyme is a specific region with a shape that complements the shape of the substrate molecules. 
	- This interaction is often compared to a lock-and-key mechanism
- **Lowering Activation Energy:** 
	- When the substrate binds to the enzyme's active site, it induces a conformational change in the enzyme. 
	- This interaction weakens the bonds in the substrate, reducing the activation energy required for the reaction.
- **Faster Reaction Rate:** 
	- By lowering the activation energy, enzymes facilitate the conversion of substrates into products more rapidly.
	- As a result, chemical reactions that might otherwise be slow or even non-existent can occur efficiently in cells
- **Reusability:** 
	- Enzymes are not consumed in the reactions they catalyze. 
	- Once the reaction is complete, the enzyme is released, and it can go on to catalyze other reactions. 
	- Enzymes can be used over and over again, making them highly efficient in cellular processes

# 4) Explain how inhibitors can affect enzyme activity
## Enzyme Inhibitors:
- Inhibit a metabolic reaction by
	- Binding to an enzyme 
	- disrupting its function
- Some of these enzyme inhibitors are actually substrate imposters that plug up the active site (competitive antagonist)
- Other inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site remote from the active site, 
- Binding changes the enzyme shape so that the active site no longer accepts the substrate (non-competitive)
- In each case an inhibitor disrupts the function of an enzyme by altering its shape
- Some cases the binding of an inhibitor is reversible

# 5) Explain and provide examples of the following terms: passive transport, simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and active transport
## Passive Transport:
- the diffusion of a substance across a membrane without the input of energy
	- **Diffusion**: 
		- The movement of molecules so that they spread out evenly into the available space
- In passive Transport:
	- a substance diffuses down its **concentration gradient** from where the substance is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated
## **Simple Diffusion:**
- passive process of molecular movement in which substances move across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, without the need for energy input
- It occurs due to the random thermal motion of molecules, and the driving force is the concentration gradient
**Example:**
- The movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of cells during respiration. 
- Oxygen moves from the lungs to the bloodstream and then into cells, while carbon dioxide moves from cells to the bloodstream and then out of the body through the lungs
## facilitated diffusion:
- An assisted transport is a type of passive transport because it does not require the cell to expend energy
- Substances that do not cross membranes spontaneously or otherwise cross very slowly can be transported via proteins that act as corridors for specific molecules
## osmosis:
- The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane is osmosis
**Example:**
- When a red blood cell is placed in a hypotonic solution (lower solute concentration outside the cell), water will move into the cell to equalize the concentration, causing the cell to swell and potentially burst. 
- Conversely, if the red blood cell is placed in a hypertonic solution (higher solute concentration outside the cell), water will move out of the cell, causing it to shrink. 
- Osmosis plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and balance in various biological processes.
## active transport:
- Requires that a cell expend energy to move molecules across a membrane
- Pumping of molecules across membranes
**Example:**
- The sodium-potassium pump in animal cells is an example of active transport. 
- This integral membrane protein uses energy from ATP to actively transport three sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and two potassium ions (K+) into the cell against their concentration gradients. 
- This pump is vital for maintaining the cell's electrochemical balance and plays a crucial role in nerve signal transmission and muscle contraction

# 6) Explain and provide examples of the following terms: hypertonic, isotonic and hypotonic
## Hypertonic:
- solution has a higher concentration of solute
- When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water molecules tend to move out of the cell, causing it to shrink or undergo plasmolysis. 
- This is because the higher concentration of solutes outside the cell draws water out of the cell to equalize the concentrations
**Example:**
- When you sprinkle salt on a slice of cucumber, the salt draws out the water from the cucumber cells, causing them to shrink and become dehydrated

## isotonic:
- solution has an equal concentration of solute
- When a cell is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net movement of water, and the cell maintains its normal shape and size
**Example:**
- When red blood cells are in isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl), they neither gain nor lose water, and their size remains unchanged

## hypotonic:
- solution has a lower concentration of solute
- When a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water molecules tend to move into the cell, causing it to swell or even burst (lyse). 
- This is because the higher concentration of solutes inside the cell draws water into the cell to equalize the concentrations
**Example:**
- When plant roots absorb water from the soil, the soil solution is often hypotonic compared to the plant cells. 
- As a result, water enters the plant cells, allowing the plant to maintain its turgor pressure and stay upright

# 7) Explain and provide examples of the following terms: exocytosis, endocytosis, phagocytosis and pinocytosis.
## exocytosis:
- is the secretion of large molecules within transport vesicles
- a cellular process in which large molecules, waste products, or cellular substances enclosed in membrane-bound vesicles are expelled from the cell into the extracellular space
- the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, releasing its contents outside the cell
**Example:**
- Neurotransmitter release from nerve cells is an example of exocytosis. 
- When a nerve signal reaches the end of a neuron, neurotransmitters stored in vesicles are released into the synapse to transmit the signal to the next neuron or target cell

## endocytosis:
- takes material in via vesicles that bud inward from the plasma membrane
- involves the uptake of substances from the external environment into the cell
- the cell membrane invaginates, forming a vesicle that encloses the extracellular material and then pinches off into the cell
**Example:**
- When a white blood cell engulfs a foreign bacterium to destroy it, it uses endocytosis to internalize the bacterium within a vesicle called a phagosome

## Phagocytosis:
- Engulfing large particles (in WBCs)
- a specific type of endocytosis where the cell engulfs large solid particles such as bacteria, cellular debris, or other foreign material
- critical process for the immune system to eliminate pathogens and cellular waste
**Example:**
- Amoebas and certain white blood cells, like macrophages, use phagocytosis to engulf and digest invading bacteria and other particles

## Pinocytosis
- Uptake of food and dissolved substances
- type of endocytosis, but instead of engulfing solid particles, the cell takes in small droplets of extracellular fluid containing dissolved substances
**Example:**
- The lining cells of the small intestine absorb nutrients from the digested food by using pinocytosis to internalize small droplets of fluid containing nutrients
