# 2) Compare the structure of plant cells and animal cells
## Plant Cells:
- **Cell Wall**: Plant cells have rigid and thick cell wall composed of cellulose, providing support and protection to the cell. Animal don't have this
- **Chloroplasts:** Plant cells have chloroplasts, specialized organelles responsible for photosynthesis. These organelles contain chlorophyll enabling plants to convert sunlight into energy. Animal cells don't have a chloroplasts
- **Large Vacuole:** Plant cells typically have a large vacuole that stores water, nutrients, and waste products. Animal cells may have smaller vacuoles but they are not as prominent or centrally located 
- Plasmodesmata: Plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata, microscopic channels that allow direct communications and transport of substances between neighboring cells. Animal cells don't have this
## Animal Cells:
- **Centrioles:** Animal cells have centrioles, which are involved in cell division (except in mature red blood cells). Plant cells lack centrioles.
- **Lysosomes:** Animal cells contain lysosomes, which are responsible for intracellular digestion and waste removal. Plant cells have similar structures called lytic vacuoles, but they are less common and have different functions
- **Cilia and Flagella:** Many animal cells possess cilia (short hair-like projections) or flagella (long whip-like tails), which are used for cell movement. Plant cells do not have these structures.

# 3) Describe the structure and function of a plasma membrane.
- **Plasma Membrane:** crucial component of all living cells. It forms the outer boundary of the cell, separating the cell's internal environment (cytoplasm) from the external environment surrounding it. Maintaining the cell's integrity and regulating the movement of substances in and out of the cell. It is a selectively permeable barrier, meaning it allows certain molecules to pass through while preventing others from freely crossing.
- **Structure:**
	- **Phospholipid Bilayer:** 
		- consists of a double layer of phospholipids. Phospholipids have a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and two hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails.
		- these molecules arrange themselves so that their hydrophobic tails face each other, creating a hydrophobic core sandwiched between two hydrophilic surfaces.
	- **Proteins:** 
		- Scattered throughout the phospholipid bilayer are various proteins
		- proteins can either be embedded within the bilayer (integral proteins) or loosely attached to its surface (peripheral proteins)
		- Proteins play diverse roles in the membrane, such as transporting molecules, serving as receptors for signaling, and facilitating cell-to-cell communication
	- **Cholesterol:** 
		- Cholesterol molecules are present within the phospholipid bilayer
		- They help maintain the membrane's stability and fluidity by preventing the fatty acid chains of phospholipids from packing too tightly together or becoming too fluid
- **Function:** 
	- **Cellular Barrier:** 
		- acts as a semi-permeable barrier that separates the inside of the cell from the extracellular environment
		- prevents the unrestricted movement of various substances, allowing the cell to maintain a stable internal environment essential for its proper functioning
	- **Selective Permeability:**
		- The plasma membrane controls the passage of molecules and ions into and out of the cell
		- It employs various mechanisms like diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport to regulate the movement of essential nutrients, ions, and waste products
	- **Cell Recognition and Signaling:**
		- Membrane proteins play a critical role in cell recognition and signaling processes
		- They serve as receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling molecules, initiating specific cellular responses
	- **Cell Adhesion:**
		- The plasma membrane also aids in cell adhesion, helping cells stick together to form tissues and organs
		- Certain proteins on the cell surface facilitate these adhesion interactions

# 4) Compare the structures and functions of the following components of the endomembrane system: rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles.
## Rough Endoplasmic reticulum
- Ribosomes that stud the outside of its membrane
- The ER makes more membrane
- Ribosomes attached to the rough ER produce proteins that will be 
	- inserted into the growing ER membrane 
	- transported to other organelles and
	- eventually exported
- Products made by rough ER are chemically modified and then packaged into transport vesicles 
## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Lacks surface ribosomes 
- Produces lipids like steroids 
- helps liver cells detoxify circulating drugs, alcohol, and metabolic waste products
## Golgi apparatus
- Works in partnership with the ER and 
- receives, refines, stores, and distributes chemical products of the cell 
- consists of a stack of membrane plates
- Protein and lipids from ER reach the Golgi apparatus in transport vesicles
- Proteins within vesicle are usually modified by enzymes during their transit from receiving to the shipping side of the Golgi apparatus
- Shipping side of Golgi sack is a depot from which finished products can be carried in transport vesicles to other organelles or to the plasma membrane 
## Lysosomes
- Membrane-enclosed sac of digestive enzymes found in animal cells
- Most plants do not contain lysosomes
- Enzymes in a lysosome can break down large molecules such as 
	- proteins
	- polysaccharides
	- fats
	- nucleic acids
- Lysosomes have several types of digestive functions
	- Many single-celled protists engulf nutrients in tiny cytoplasmic sacs called food vacuoles 
	- Lysosomes fuse with the food vacuole, exposing the food to digestive enzymes
	- Small molecules that results from this digestion, such as amino acids, leave lysosome and nourish the cell
- Can also 
	- Destroy harmful bacteria
	- engulf and digest parts of another organelle
	- sculpt tissues during embryonic development, helping to form structures such as fingers
- Hereditary disorders called lysosomal storage diseases: 
	- missing one or more of the digestive enzymes normally found within lysosomes
	- lysosomes become engorged with indigestible substances which eventually interfere with other cellular functions

## Vacuoles
- Large sacs made of membrane that bud off from the ER or Golgi apparatus
- Vacuoles have a variety of functions:
	- food vacuoles bud from the plasma membrane 
	- certain freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles that pump out excess water that flows into the cell from the outside environment
- Central vacuole can account for more than half the volume of a mature plant cell
- The central vacuole of a plant cell is a versatile compartment that may
	- store organic nutrients
	- absorb water 
	- contain pigments that attract pollinating insects or poisons that protests against plant-eating animals

# Explain the endosymbiotic theory and the evidence in support of it.
- proposes that certain organelles found in eukaryotic cells, namely mitochondria and chloroplasts, originated from ancient prokaryotic organisms that were engulfed by a host cell in a symbiotic relationship
- the endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotic organisms that were engulfed by a host cell, leading to a symbiotic relationship where they became integrated as organelles within the eukaryotic cell
## Evidence
- **Organelle Structure:** 
	- Mitochondria and chloroplasts have distinct similarities to free-living prokaryotes. 
	- They both have a double membrane structure, similar to prokaryotic cells, and their own DNA, which is circular like prokaryotic DNA.
- **Reproduction:** 
	- Mitochondria and chloroplasts reproduce independently within the cell through a process similar to binary fission, similar to prokaryotes.
- **Genetic Similarities:** 
	- The DNA of mitochondria and chloroplasts is more closely related to bacterial DNA than to the nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells. 
	- This suggests that they evolved from bacteria that were once independent cells.
- **Endosymbiotic Relationships in Nature:** 
	- Similar symbiotic relationships exist in nature, where one organism lives inside another for mutual benefit. 
	- This strengthens the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent organisms that became incorporated into eukaryotic cells

# 6) compare the structure and function of chloroplasts and mitochondria 
## Structure:
- **Chloroplasts:** Double-membrane organelles found in plant cells and some protists. They contain stacks of thylakoids where chlorophyll is present, and a fluid-filled stroma.
- **Mitochondria:** Double-membrane organelles found in eukaryotic cells. They have an inner membrane with folds called cristae, enclosing a gel-like matrix
## Function:
- **Chloroplasts:** Site of photosynthesis, where light energy is converted into chemical energy (glucose) using chlorophyll. Produce oxygen as a byproduct.
- **Mitochondria:** Site of cellular respiration, where glucose and oxygen are used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency. Produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct

# 7) Describe the functions of the cytoskeleton. Compare the structures and functions of cilia and flagella
## Cytoskeleton:
- a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm
- provides mechanical support to the cell
- helps a cell maintain its shape
- contribute to the amoeboid (crawling) movements of the protist Amoeba
- A cell’s cytoskeleton is dynamic
	- quickly dismantled in one part of the cell by removing protein subunits and re-formed in a new location by reattaching the subunits
- Such rearrangement can
	- provide rigidity in a new location
	- change the shape of the cell
	- or even cause the whole cell or some of its parts to move
## **Cilia and Flagella:**
- **Structure:** 
	- Cilia and flagella are hair-like structures composed of microtubules arranged in a 9+2 pattern. 
	- Cilia are short and numerous, while flagella are longer and usually exist singly or in pairs
- **Function:** 
	- Both cilia and flagella are involved in cell movement.
	- Cilia are often found on the surfaces of cells and beat in coordinated waves to move substances along the cell surface or propel the cell itself. 
	- Flagella, typically present at one or both ends of the cell, provide a whip-like motion that propels the cell through its environment
## **Comparison:**
- The cytoskeleton is an intricate network of protein filaments within the cell, providing structural support and facilitating various cellular processes
- Cilia and flagella are specific cellular appendages made of microtubules, primarily responsible for cell movement in different ways - cilia for moving substances along cell surfaces and flagella for propelling the cell itself
