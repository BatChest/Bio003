# 1) Write the overall equation for cellular respiration (reactants and products).
## Overall Equation:
- **C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 (oxygen) â†’ 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6 H2O (water) + approx. 32 ATP**

# 2) Compare the reactants, products, location in the cell, and energy yield of the stages of cellular respiration (glycolysis, Acetyl-CoA production, citric acid cycle and electron transport chain)
## **Glycolysis:**
- Reactants: Glucose (C6H12O6), 2 ATP, 2 NAD+
- Products: 2 Pyruvate, 4 ATP (net gain of 2 ATP), 2 NADH
- Location: Occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.
- Energy Yield: Net production of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.

## **Acetyl-CoA Production (Link Reaction):**
- Reactants: 2 Pyruvate, Coenzyme A (CoA), NAD+
- Products: 2 Acetyl-CoA, 2 CO2, 2 NADH
- Location: Occurs in the mitochondria, specifically in the mitochondrial matrix.
- Energy Yield: 2 NADH produced.

## **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):**
- Reactants: 2 Acetyl-CoA, 6 NAD+, 2 FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), ADP, and Pi (in the form of H2O and an inorganic phosphate).
- Products: 4 CO2, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, 2 ATP (by substrate-level phosphorylation), Coenzyme A (CoA).
- Location: Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
- Energy Yield: Produces 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.

## **Electron Transport Chain (ETC):**
- Reactants: NADH, FADH2, oxygen (O2).
- Products: H2O (water), NAD+, FAD, ATP (produced through chemiosmosis phosphorylation).
- Location: Occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, specifically on the cristae (folded structures).
- Energy Yield: The most significant energy yield of cellular respiration comes from the ETC. It produces a large number of ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation, with each NADH producing approximately 3 ATP and each FADH2 producing approximately 2 ATP.


# 3) Describe the process of fermentation and how it differs from cellular respiration. (Products of fermentation)
## Fermentation:
- An anaerobic(without oxygen) harvest of food energy 
- After functioning anaerobically for about 15 seconds muscle cells begin to generate ATP by the process of fermentation
- Relies on glycolysis to produce ATP
- End products depend on the type of fermentation:
	- Lactic Acid Fermentation: Produces lactic acid (lactate).
	- Alcohol (Ethanol) Fermentation: Produces ethanol (alcohol).

## **Cellular Respiration:**
- Aerobic process (requires oxygen).
- Complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis, Acetyl-CoA production, citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain.
- Produces a large amount of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.
- Final electron acceptor is oxygen.

## **Comparison:**
- Fermentation occurs without oxygen, while cellular respiration requires oxygen.
- Fermentation produces a smaller amount of ATP compared to cellular respiration.
- Fermentation generates different end products (lactic acid or ethanol), while cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide and water.
