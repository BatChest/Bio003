# 1) Distinguish between matter, chemical elements, and compounds. Give examples of each.
- **Matter**: 
	- Anything that occupies space and has mass 
	- matter is found on Earth in 3 physical states: solid, liquid, and gas
- **Chemical Elements:** 
	- Substances that cannot be broken down into other substances
	- there are 92 naturally occurring elements on Earth
	- Example: carbon, oxygen, gold
- **Compounds:** 
	- Are substances that contain two or more elements in a fixed ratio; 
	- Example: table salt and water

# 2) Describe the relative size, location, and electrical charge of protons, neutrons, and electrons within an atom. Explain how the atomic number and mass number are determined.
- Atoms are composed of subatomic particles:
	- Protons
	- electrons
	- Neutrons
- A proton is a subatomic particle with a single unit of positive electrical charge (+) 
- An electron is a subatomic particle with a single unit of negative charge (-) no electrical charge
- A neutron is electrically neutral (no electrical charge) 
- Number of protons in an atom is the atomic number that determines which element it is 
- Mass number is just the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus

# 3) Define an isotope and explain how isotopes are used in biological research and medicine. (Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14)
- **Isotope:** 
	- A variant form of an atom; isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons but different number of neutrons
- Radioactive isotopes have many uses in research and medicine:
	- Used to determine the fate of atoms in living organism
	- They are used in PET (positron emission tomography) scans to diagnose heat disorders and some cancers

# 4) Explain how the number of electrons determines the chemical properties of an atom.
- The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the chemical properties of an atom
- The number of electrons in an atom determines its chemical properties as it governs how the atom interacts with other atoms through the formation of chemical bonds
- the configuration of valence electrons influences the atom's reactivity and ability to achieve a stable electron arrangement.
- **Electron Configuration**: 
	- The arrangement of electrons in different energy levels or electron shells around the atom's nucleus is known as the electron configuration
	- The number of electrons in each shell determines the atom's chemical behavior as it dictates how the electrons interact with other atoms.
- **Valence Electrons**: 
	- The electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons
	- These electrons are involved in chemical bonding, and the number of valence electrons largely determines how an atom will form chemical bonds with other atoms.
- **Chemical Bonding**: 
	- Atoms tend to achieve a stable electron configuration by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons with other atoms
	- This leads to the formation of chemical bonds, such as covalent bonds (sharing electrons) and ionic bonds (transferring electrons), which ultimately determine the structure and properties of molecules and compounds.
- **Reactivity**: 
	- The number of valence electrons influences an atom's reactivity, which is its tendency to undergo chemical reactions with other atoms
	- Atoms with incomplete valence shells (fewer than eight electrons) are more reactive as they seek to attain a stable electron configuration through bonding
- **Chemical Properties**: 
	- The chemical properties of an atom are closely related to its ability to form compounds, the types of bonds it can form (covalent, ionic), and its reactivity with other elements
	- Example, elements in the same group of the periodic table tend to have similar chemical properties due to the same number of valence electrons.

# 5) Distinguish between ionic, covalent, and hydrogen chemical bonds.
- **Ionic Bods:**
	- When atom loses or gains electrons, becomes electrically charged
	- Changed atoms are called ions
	- Ionic Bonds are formed between oppositely charged ions(transfer of electron from one atom to another)
![Pasted image 20230719142818](https://github.com/BatChest/Bio003/assets/90287766/aeeef3e1-3251-46b4-938d-b33e986a1387)

- **Covalent Bonds:**
	- Forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of outer shells electrons
	- Strongest of the various bonds
	- Hold atoms together in a molecule
	- Number of covalent bonds an atom can form is equal to the number of additional electrons needed to fill its outer shell
- **Hydrogen Bonds:**
	- Water is a compound which electrons in its covalent bonds are not shared equally 
		- Causes water to be a polar molecule, one with an uneven distribution of charge
	- Polarity of water results in weak electrical attractions between neighboring water molecules
		- These weak attractions are called hydrogen bonds

# 6) Describe the structure of water and explain how its shape makes water a polar molecule
- The water molecule (H2O) consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. 
- The unique arrangement of these atoms results in a bent shape, making water a polar molecule due to the unequal distribution of electrons, 
- with the oxygen atom being more electronegative, leading to partial negative charges near the oxygen atom and partial positive charges near the hydrogen atoms.

# 7) Describe the life-supporting properties of water. Describe an example of how each property affects some form of life.
- Polarity in water molecules and hydrogen bonding results explain the water's life-supporting properties
- **The Cohesion of Water:**
	- Stick together due to hydrogen bonding 
	- Molecules of same kind sticking together is **cohesion**
	- Cohesion vital for transporting water from the roots to the leaves of plants
	- leading to surface tension that supports small organisms like water striders, which can walk on water
- **How water moderate Temperature**:
	- Causes temperatures to stay within limits that permit life
	- **Evaporative cooling** occurs when a substance evaporates and the surface of the liquid remaining behind cools down
	- helping regulate temperature in organisms and their environments
	- allowing organisms to cool down through sweating or transpiration, thereby preventing overheating
- **Frozen water floats:**
	- When water molecules get cold, they move apart, forming ice
	- Chunk of ice has fewer water molecules than equal volume of liquid water
	- Ice floats because it is dense than liquid water
	- If ice no float, ponds, lakes, and even the oceans would freeze solid
	- Life in water could not survive if bodies of water froze solid
	- preventing freezing solid and supporting aquatic life underneath
- **Water is a common solvent for life:**
	- Solution is a liquid consisting of a homogeneous mixture of two or substances 
		- The dissolving agent is the solvent
		- The dissolved substance is the solute
	- When water is the solvent, the result is an aqueous solution
	- Water's versatility as a solvent supports various metabolic processes in living organisms, such as blood circulation, where it carries nutrients and waste products

# 8) Distinguish between the chemical properties of acids, bases, and neutral solutions. Explain how buffers stabilize the pH of acidic and basic solutions. Explain how 1-point change in PH affects hydrogen concentration
- **Acids:**
	- Chemical compound that releases H$^+$ to a solution
	- Ex: Hydrochloric acid, acid in your stomach that aids in digestion of foods
	- lower the pH of a solution (pH < 7)
- **Bases:**
	- Compound that accepts H$^+$ and removes them from solution
	- Bases like sodium hydroxide do this by releasing OH$^-$ combining H$^+$ to form H$_2$O 
	- raise the pH of a solution (pH > 7)
- **Neutral Solutions:**
	- equal concentration of H+ and OH- ions
	- resulting in a pH of 7
	- do not exhibit acidic or basic properties and are neither sour nor bitter
- **Buffers:**
	- Substances that resists pH change
	- Accepts H(+) ions when they are in excess and 
	- Donate H(+) ions when they are depleted. +
	- H(+) + HCO$_3$$^-$  <-> H$_2$CO$_3$ <-> H$_2$O + CO$_2$

- **1-point change in pH**:
	- 1-point change in pH represents a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration; moving from pH 6 to pH 5 means ten times more hydrogen ions
	- while moving from pH 6 to pH 7 means ten times fewer hydrogen ions
