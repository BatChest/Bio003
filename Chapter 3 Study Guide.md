# 1) What is lactose intolerance?
- inability to properly digest lactose
- Instead of lactose being broken down and absorbed, lactose is broken down by bacteria in the large intestine, producing gas and discomfort

# 2) Compare a dehydration reaction to hydrolysis reaction. Illustrate your answer.
- **Dehydration Reaction:**
	- two molecules combine to form larger molecule, water molecule is released as a byproduct
	- links two monomers together
	- Removes a molecule of water
	- Reactants: Molecule A(-OH) + Molecule B(-H)
	- Products: Molecule A-B + H2O
- **Hydrolysis**
	- breaks down bond between monomers
	- adds a molecule of water
	- reverses the dehydration reaction
	- Reactant: Molecule A-B + H2O
	- Products: Molecule A (-OH) + Molecule B (-H)
**Summarization:**
- Dehydration reactions build largest molecules by removing water, 
- while hydrolysis reactions break down larger molecules by adding water

# 3) Describe the structures and biological functions of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Give examples of each.
- **Carbohydrate:**
	- includes sugars and polymers of sugar
	- small sugar molecules in energy drinks 
	- long starch molecules in spaghetti and French fries 
	- **Type Of Polymer:** Polysaccharides (complex carbs)
	- **Monomers:** Monosaccharides (simple sugars)
	- **Examples:** Fructose, Sucrose, Starch, Cellulose
	- **Biological Functions:** Provide energy, structural support(plant cell walls) and serve as precursors for other molecules
- **Lipids:**
	- **Type of Polymer:** No true polymer
	- **Monomers:** N/A
	- **Examples:** Fats, Oils, Phospholipids, Steroids
	- **Biological Functions:** Energy storage, cell membrane structure, insulation, and signaling molecules
- **Proteins:**
	- **Type of polymer:** Polypeptides (long chains of amino acids)
	- **Monomers:** Amino Acids
	- **Examples:** Hemoglobin, Insulin, Enzymes
	- **Biological Functions:** Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, structural support (e.g., collagen), transport molecules (e.g. hemoglobin) and hormones (e.g. insulin)
- **Nucleic Acids:**
	- **Type of Polymer**: Polynucleotides (long chain of nucleotides)
	- **Monomers:** Nucleotides
	- **Examples:** DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid), RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
	- **Biological Functions:** DNA stores genetic information and serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and gene expression

# 4) Compare the structure and properties of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Which type of fat is worse for your health?
- **Unsaturated Fatty Acids:**
	- Have one or more double bonds between the carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon chain
	- tend to be liquid at room temperature and have lower melting point
- **Saturated Fatty Acids:**
	- If it has the max number of hydrogens 
	- No double bonds between the carbon atoms on their hydrocarbon chain
	- Tend to be solid in room temperature and have a higher melting point
- Saturated Fats are more harmful for your health
	- Increased risk of heart disease and other health issues when consumed in excess


# 5) Describe the relationship between the primary structure of proteins and the final three-dimensional shape
- Structure is enough to cause the protein to fold into a different shape, which alters its function, which inn turn causes disease
- Misfolded proteins are associated with many diseases, including severe nervous system disorders
- The sequence of the amino acids in the polypeptide chain, plays a crucial role in determining the final three-dimensional shape through interactions like hydrogen boding, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions

# 6) Describe and compare the structures of DNA and RNA. Define genes
- **DNA:**
	- Usually exists as a double helix 
	- Consists of sugar, a phosphate and a nitrogenous base
	- Sugar: Deoxyribose
	- Base pairings in a DNA molecule is specific:  A (Adenine) always pairs with T (Thymine), G (Guanine) always pairs with C (Cytosine)
	- Stores genetic information and serves as a template for protein and synthesis
- **RNA:**
	- Ribonucleic acid
	- Uses the sugar ribose and the base uracil instead of thymine
	- Single stranded 
	- Bases: Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine, Guanine
	- Functions: Acts as a messenger in protein synthesis (mRNA), aids protein synthesis (rRNA), and facilitates protein synthesis at the ribosomes (tRNA)
- **Gene:**
	- Segment of DNA that contains the instructions for building a specific protein or RNA molecule, serving as the fundamental unit of heredity and genetic information transmission in living organisms. 

# 7) Demonstrate correct complementary base pairings for DNA and RNA molecules
- **DNA:**
	- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) using two hydrogen bonds
	- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) using three hydrogen bonds
- **RNA:**
	- Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) using two hydrogen bonds
	- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) using three hydrogen bonds
