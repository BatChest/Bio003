# 1) Define Biology
- The scientific study of life
- The study of biology encompasses 
	- a wide scale of sized and 
	- a huge variety of life, both past and present  

# 2) Describe Science
- approach of understanding the natural world that is based on inquiry 
- Search for information, evidence, explanations, answers
- Focus on solely study of structures and processes that can verifiably observed and measured

# 3) Describe seven properties or processes we associate with life 
## 1) Having an ordered structure
- Living organisms are composed of one or more cells
- Ex: Turtles structure is regular arrangement of plates in the turtle shell
## 2) Reproduction
- Living organisms can produce offspring through asexual or sexual reproduction passing genetic information to the next generation
- Turtles have reproduction cycle,  female lay eggs of 100-200 eggs into a hole dug in a beach
## 3) Growth and Development
- Living organisms grow, increasing in size and complexity and undergo development, which involves changes in structure and function over time
- For turtles to mature into adults sea turtles takes decades
## 4) Energy Utilization
- Living organisms carry out various chemical reactions to obtain and utilize energy, allowing them to maintain their internal process and grow
- Adult sea turtles depends upon a diet of algae and sea grass
## 5) Responses to Environment
- Organisms can sense and respond to changes in their environment with various mechanics ensuring their survival and adaptation
- Sea turtles and hatchlings varies in responses as warmer temperatures favor the development of females, while cooler temperatures favor the development of males
## 6) Homeostasis
- Organisms can regulate their internal environment to maintain a relatively stable and balanced state, despite changes to the external environment
- Sea turtles being large organisms the body of a sea turtle is made of trillions of cells
## 7) Evolutionary Adaptation
- Organisms undergo genetic changes over generations, leading to biological diversity and adaptation to different environments through the process of natural selection 
- Turtle evolution believe that they first appeared nearly 250 millions years ago, making their lineage older than dinosaurs 


# 4) List and give an example of each level of biological organization

# 5) Compare discovery science(Exploaration) and hypothesis-driven science
- Discovery Science describes life at its many levels from ecosystems down to cells and molecules
- Hypothesis driven science has hypothsis as a tentative answer to a question - an explanation of trial 
- Discovery science, also known as exploration science, focuses on observing and gathering data from the natural world without a preconceived hypothesis, allowing for the discovery of new phenomena and patterns. In contrast, hypothesis-driven science involves formulating a specific hypothesis and designing experiments to test it, aiming to confirm or reject the proposed explanation.

# 6) Distinguish between a hypothesis and a theory
- A hypothsis is a tentative answer to a question or an explantation on trial
- Theory is much broader in scope than a hypothsis. Is a comprehensive and well-substained explanation 
- A hypothesis is a testable explanation for a specific phenomenon, while a theory is a well-substantiated and widely accepted explanation that encompasses a broad range of related phenomena and has withstood rigorous testing and scrutiny.

# 7) Name and explain the 5 Major Themes in Biology
1) **Evolution**: Process of change that has transformed life on Earth from its earliest forms to the vast array of organisms living today
	1) fundemental principle of life and the core that unifies all of biology 
	2) Theory of evolution by natural selection, first described by Charles Darwin
2) **Structure/Function**
	1) Correlation of strcuture and function can be seen at every level of biological organization
	2) The shape of red blood cells provides a large surface areaa over which oxygen can diffuse
3) **Information Flow**
	1) Information must be stored transmitted and used for life' function to proceed
	2) Genome: entire set of genetic information that an organim inherits
4) **Energy Transmition:**
	1) Interconnected chemical reactions (motabolism) continually converts energy from one form to another as matter is recyceld
	2) Can be disrupted often with consequences. 
	3) Example: cynanide is so toxic because it blocks an essential step within the metabolic pathway that harvests energy from glucose
5) **Interconnections within Biological Systems**
	1) refers to the intricate relationships and interactions between various components, such as cells, tissues, organs, and organisms, where changes or disruptions in one component can impact the functioning and behavior of the entire system, illustrating the complex and interconnected nature of biological processes.
